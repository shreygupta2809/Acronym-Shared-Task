BS,bias,821,This  eliminates the potential BS that clustering the entities  becomes easier if the entities are clearly from different  genres.
BS,bias,822,"However, this would introduce systematic BSes into the counts, because nouns do in fact very often occur adjacently to prepositions that modify them, but many verbs do not."
BS,bias,823,"(Volk, 2002) already suggested that this count- ing method introduced a general BS toward verb attachment, and when comparing the results for very frequent words (for which more reliable evi- dence is available from the treebank) we find that verb attachments are in fact systematically over- estimated."
BS,bias,824,"Nor  do we use the gender/animiticity information  gathered from the much smaller hand-marked  text, both because we were interested in seeing  what unsupervised learning could accomplish,  and because we were concerned with inherit-  ing strong BSes from the limited hand-marked  data."

ME,Microelectronics,1560,This paper discusses preparation of templates and presents results for human and machine per- formance for English ME ; a companion paper [1] presents additional experimental results.
ME,Microelectronics,1561,"To improve quality and consistency, three steps were taken : First, a set of relatively detailed rules for extracting information from articles and structuring it as an object - oriented template was developed (with the rules for English ME a 40-page, single-spaced document) ."
ME,Microelectronics,1562,"Previous experience with the English and Japanese Joint Ventures corpus had made it clear that producin g templates with a high degree of quality and consistency is a difficult and time-consuming task 11l, and we attempte d 54 to make the best use of what had been learned in that effort in producing templates for English ME with quality and consistency appropriate to both the needs of the project and the resources we had available ."

NB,na??ve Bayes,1566,"In this paper we generalize the tri-training al- gorithm and use three different learning algo- rithms rather than bootstrap samples to create diversity: a NB algorithm (no smooth- ing), random forests (Breiman, 2001) (with 100 unpruned decision trees) and an algorithm that induces unpruned decision trees."
NB,na??ve Bayes,1567,"In their exper- iments, they consider classifiers based on deci- sion trees, BP neural networks and NB inference."
NB,na??ve Bayes,1568,"We have experimented with a maxi- mum entropy model, Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (RIP- PER), and decision trees; preliminary results do not show significant improvement over the NBian model."
NB,na??ve Bayes,1569,"This contrasts with typical semi-supervised learning methods for text categorization that com- bine unlabeled and labeled data within a genera- tive model, such as multinomial NB, via expectation-maximization (Nigam et al, 2000) or semi-supervised frequency estimation (Su et al, 2011)."
NB,na??ve Bayes,1570,"For the NBian classification method, indeed, it is most important that the features be as independent of each other as possible."
NB,Na??ve Bayesian,1571,"We used the NLTK (Bird, 2006) implementation of the NB classifier for all our experiments."
NB,Na??ve Bayesian,1572,"ME classifiers outperform their generative counterparts (e.g., NB clas- sifiers) because they can easily handle overlapping, probably dependent features which might be con- tained in rich feature sets."

CC,coordinations,2040,"For binary trees, the coordination is represented by a left-branching tree, which is a conjunction or a con- junction particle that first joined a left hand con- stituent; the phrase is marked as a modifier consist- ing of coordination (-NCOORD and -VCOORD for NP and VP CC), as shown on the left side of Figure 3."
CC,coordinations,2041,"Indeed, according to this approach  (Chomsky, 1957; Banfield, 1981), only coordination  of sentences are basic and other syntagmatic coordi-  nations should be considered as CC of re-  duced sentences, the reduction being performed by  deleting repeated elements."

EDUs,elementary discourse units,2627,"Following Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST; Mann and Thompson 1988), they represent documents by trees whose leaves correspond to EDUs (edus) and whose nodes specify how these and larger units (e.g., multi-sentence segments) are linked to each other by rhetorical relations (e.g., Contrast, Elaboration)."
EDUs,elementary discourse units,2628,"We stud- ied how preferences are linguistically expressed in EDUs on two different cor- pus genres: one already available, the Verbmobil corpus and the Booking corpus purposely built for this project."
EDUs,elementary discourse units,2629,Each discourse analy-  sis yielded an average of 52 EDUs.

EDUs,elementary discourse units,2631,"4 This is the decision-based parser described in Marcu (2000); it achieves an F1 of 38.2 for the identification of EDUs, 50.0 for hierarchical spans, 39.9 for nuclearity, and 23.4 for relation assignment."
EDUs,elementary discourse units,2632,"Our Dis- course Parser uses a symbolic approach and pro- duces discourse trees, which include nuclearity,  but lacking rhetorical relation names: intermedi- ate nodes in the discourse tree have no name and  terminal nodes are EDUs,  mainly clauses."

DM,dialogue move,2662,1 Introduction Determining when to make a DM is a topic of growing importance in dialogue systems.
DM,dialogue move,2663,"Because turn boundaries are not clearly defined or enforced, we apply RL to the problem of when to make a DM, rather than what type of DM to make."
DM,dialogue move,2664,"To date, RL has been applied to learn the most effective DM to make, but has not been applied to learning the timings of these moves, although the related con-cept of when to release a turn has been explored (English and Heeman 2005)."
DM,dialogue move,2665,"It consists of 66 textual dia-logues between human tutors and students, with an average of 90 tutor DMs and 36 student DMs."

GNF,Greibach Normal Form,3585,"The first part of the following theorem follows from the existence of a GNF for ECFG (Albert et al, 1999)."
GNF,Greibach Normal Form,3586,Watanabe et al (2006) introduce an Early- style top-down parser based on binary-branching GNF.
GNF,Greibach Normal Form,3587,"It is known that a context free grammar can be con- verted to GNF, where each pro- duction will have the form:  *aVA ? ,"
GNF,Greibach Normal Form,3588,"Since GcFc is in GNF,  it is easy to make one-to-one correspondence between  a word in a sentence and a rule application in a  phrase-structure t e. The details of the proof are  given in Maruyama (1990)."
GNF,Greibach Normal Form,3589,"This can  be proved by constructing a constraint dependency  grammar GCDG from an arbitrary context-free gram-  mar GCFG in GNF, and by show-  ing that the two grammars generate exactly the same  language."
GNF,Greibach Normal Form,3590,"as a result, their framework requires gram- mar transformation into the binary-branching GNF (which is not always possible) so that the resulting grammar always contain at least one Chinese word in each rule in order for a prediction step to always make progress."
GNF,Greibach Normal Form,3591,Watanabe et al (2006) further reduces the grammar?s size by enforcing all rules to comply with GNF.
GNF,Greibach normal form,3592,"We have also presented a descrip-  tion method of such predictions as grammar ules which is based  on GNF, mad recognition mechanisms that are  specified by these rules, realized by using three stacks: the predic-  tion stack, the and stack, and the NP stack."
GNF,Greibach normal form,3593,We make use of  three kinds of stacks whose behavior is specified by grammar rules  in an extended version of GNF.
GNF,Greibach normal form,3594,GNF pro-  vides a well-known example of such a lexical-  ized context-free formalism.

CT,constituent tree,3626,The output of the parser is twofold: it produces a CT as well as a linkage that shows the dependencies between words.
CT,constituent tree,3627,"Along with negation focus annotation,  this corpus also contains other annotations, such  as POS tag, named entity, chunk, CT,  dependency tree, and semantic role."
CT,constituent tree,3628,"In contrast, Lexical-Functional Grammar (Kaplan &  Bresnan 1982; Kaplan 1989), which assigns  representations consisting of a surface CT  enriched with a corresponding functional structure, is  known to be beyond context-free."

CT,contrast,3633,"2 Anaphora,  by CT, is a nonsymmetrical and nontransi-  tive relation: if NP1 is anaphoric to NP2 then,  usually, NP2 is not anaphoric to NP1, for ex-  ample."
CT,contrast,3634,"In CT, the project described here has explored a non-cancellation analysis for Wambaya: even after a head combines with one of its argu- ments, that argument remains on the appropriate va- lence list of the mother, so that it is visible for further combination with modifiers."

REL,relational,4359,"described by three design decisions: (1) instead of building a pipeline using local classifier technology, we design and learn a joint probabilistic model over events in a sentence; (2) instead of developing spe- cific inference and learning algorithms for our joint model, we apply Markov Logic, a general purpose Statistical Relation Learn- ing language, for this task; (3) we represent events as REL structures over the to- kens of a sentence, as opposed to structures that explicitly mention abstract event en- tities."
REL,relational,4360,"Then, the term arguments of each REL triple are assigned to the latter, originating a wordnet."
REL,relational,4361,"By mapping to REL structure over grounded text, we also show a direct connection to recent formulations of Semantic Role Labelling which may be helpful in the future."
REL,relational,4362,Let us introduce Markov Logic by considering the event extraction task (as REL structure over tokens as generated by algorithm 1).

REL,relations,4365,The former captures more distant REL compared to the latter.
REL,relations,4366,"Thus, unary adjectives denote properties and binary adjec- tives denote REL."
REL,relations,4367,The passive char- acters were identified via the following REL extracted by dependency parsing: nsubjpass (passive nominal subject) and pobj (object of a preposition).
REL,relations,4368,"However, although there is indeed a certain corre- lation between morphological class and semantic class, we claim that morphology is not sufficient for a reliable classification because it is by no means a one-to-one RELhip."

MS,multi-speaker,5129,"The speech corpora consist of one MS sponta- neous corpus, containing twenty segments and totaling fty minutes, and one read corpus of ve segments, read by a single speaker and to- taling eleven minutes of speech."
MS,multi-speaker,5130,"We tried to restrict ourselves to features whose inclusion is motivated by previous work (pauses, speech rate) and added features that are specific to MS speech (overlap, changes in speaker activity)."
MS,multi-speaker,5131,Guest actors and MS turns are not considered in the gen- der analysis.
MS,multi-speaker,5132,"In the future, we hope  to further enlarge our MS database."
MS,multi-speaker,5133,"Performance measures used to date within the DARPA spo-  ken language research community (and included in this  paper) do not conform to the recommended approach, since  the scoring software, in general, generates a single measure-  merit for the ensemble of test data (e.g., one datum indicat-  ing word or utterance error rate for the entire MS,  multi-utterance, t st subset, rather than the mean error rate  for the ensemble of speakers)."

MS,Marecek and Straka,5138,"We then search for what IR (with the MaxEnc op- tion) contributes to the overall performance by com- paring the quality of the treebank resulted in the end of phase 1 against the quality of the treebank given by its initialier, i.e. MS (2013)."
MS,Marecek and Straka,5139,"The position and shape of N(D i ) is thus deter- mined by two factors: how well P i can fit D i , and k. Intuitively, the lower the fitness is, the more N(D i ) goes far away fromD i ; and the larger k is, the larger 3 MS (2013) did not report any experimental result on the WSJ corpus."
MS,Marecek and Straka,5140,"Naseem and Barzilay (2011), Tu and Honavar (2012), Spitkovsky et al (2012), Spitkovsky et al (2013), and MS (2013) employ ex- tensions of the DMV but with different learning strategies."

VBD,past tense verb,6504,"This accounts for the fact that the English PP[in] can have the anchored interpre- tation in a clause with a future auxiliary, such as (12) and (39), or in a clause with a futurate present tense, such as we are leaving in a minute, but not in a clause with a VBD, such as (2), or in a clause with a non-futurate present tense, such as (11)."

VBD,past tense verb,6509,"For example, the triple \[1\] 'be'  \[2\] adverb \[3\] past-tense-verb has been assigned a  scaling factor which downgrades a sequence contain-  ing this triple compared with a competing sequence  of \[1\] 'be' \[2\] adverb \[3\]-past-participle/adjective, on  the basis that after a form of 'be', past participles and  adjectives are more likely than a VBD  (Marshall (1983), p. 146)."
VBD,verb past tense,6510,"In some cases, such as VBDs or noun plurals, morphological distinctions found in Czech are also found in English."
VBD,verb past tense,6511,"Main verb tenses are indefinitely referential, cre-  ating a new temporal entity under constraints  imposed by its type (i.e., past, present, or fu-  ture) in relation to a discourse reference time 2 tR.  For instance, a main VBD introduces a new temporal entity t under the constraint prior-  to(t, tR)."
VBD,verb past tense,6512,"This allows to generate out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and phrases, which are not only recogni- tion errors, but also plausible variants of different source phrases that can be translated to one tar- get phrase, e.g., VBD forms or function words."
